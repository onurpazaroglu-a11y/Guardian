# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Guardian

## 1. Vision
Guardian is a modular decision support system designed for manual traders. It doesn't trade automatically but provides "Guardians" (Blocker, Signal, Scorer) to help traders make more consistent and disciplined decisions.

## 2. Target Audience
- Retail crypto traders who trade manually on exchanges like Binance.
- Traders who struggle with overtrading or lack of discipline.
- Users who want a second opinion based on multiple technical indicators.

## 3. Core Features
- **Consistency Scoring:** A 0-100 score indicating how well different indicators align.
- **Guardian Blocker:** Automatically blocks analysis results if the consistency score is below a safe threshold.
- **Guardian Signal:** Provides entry zones, stop loss, and take profit levels based on strategies (Breakout, Pullback, Continuation).
- **Pro Tier:** Subscription-based access to lower timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m) and real-time alerts.

## 4. Success Metrics
- **Analysis Repeatability:** Users following the same strategy should get consistent scores.
- **Accuracy:** Signal zones should respect historical support/resistance levels.
- **Retention:** Active daily users checking the dashboard before their manual trades.
